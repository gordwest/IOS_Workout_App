# Get Strong | IOS Application

#### A workout app for gym goers made by a gym goer. Now available on the Apple App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/getstrong/id1525168308)

### This app will guide you to become stronger in the gym. It is designed to be used for compound exercises only. It is a 3 week cycle consisting of at least 2 days per week of a specific exercise (ex. doing bench press twice a week for 3 weeks). It also comes equiped with a 1 rep max calculator to estimate how strong you currently are.
